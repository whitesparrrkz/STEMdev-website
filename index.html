    <h2>Welcome to the STEMdev Website! <em>(WIP)</em></h2>

    <p>We are a club in <a href="https://stemacademy.riversideunified.org/">Riverside STEM Academy</a>
    where we learn how to program and create programming projects!</p>

    <br>
    <h3>What were currently working on</h3>
    <p>We are currently learning about HTML and CSS to create our own personal websites</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Our Goal</h3>
    <p>Our goal with this club is to use our knowledge of programming
    to create projects that help out students and staff here at RSA.</p>
    <p><em>We are still deciding on what the final application will include</em></p>
    <p>Some current ideas include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating a calendar that tracks all student HW, tests, and events.</li>
        <li>A page where students can access all school resources</li>
        <li>A system where students can borrow a chromebook online</li>
        <li>(and etc.)</li>
    </ul>
